-- once we have push all the code into the central repo 

-- we have only one branch which is "main"

-- so now i want to change / update my code , but without do impact to the real users .

-- so , for this I ahve to create one another branch 

-- create another branch by using  

            git branch <branch Name>

-- now move to new branch 

            git checkout <branch Name>

-- once u switch to the new branch , U will have all the code from the main branch (as it is whatever u have in main branch , u will have all the things in new branch also)       

-- now here we want to do some update in the code so , change the content in the index.html page , remember u are in new branch and doing some update to the code 

-- so now do commit this changes 

-- if u r using vs code , then click on source control (icon 3rd one in panel) , click on tick sysmbol and add message to ur commit .

-- now once u do commit , these changes will do reflce to ur new branch only , not in the main branch 

        do git log 


-- now do shift to the main branch , by using < git checkout main>
